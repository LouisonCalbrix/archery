How to play
=============

### Requirements

This game was developped using python3.5 and pygame 1.9.6. You will need both of these to run it. Here are informations about how to install Python, and the pygame module on your machine.      
[How to install Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)      
[How to install Python on Unix Platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)      
[How to install Python on Mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#getting-and-installing-macpython)      

To install pygame type the following command in your terminal:     
```pip3 install --user pygame```      

### Game installation

Now that you have every thing you need to run the game you need to download the game. There are several ways of doing so.

If you have git installed on your computer, open a terminal in the folder where you want the game installed and then type:     
```git clone https://github.com/LouisonCalbrix/archery.git```     

If you don't have git, don't panic. Click the 'Clone or download' button up there and then 'Download ZIP'. Once this is done, just unzip that file wherever you want the game to sit on your machine.

### Lauching the game

To launch the game type in your terminal:     
```python3 archery.py```
