Archery is a mini game made with Python using pygame. In this game a bow crosses endlessly the screen from top to bottom and back, there also is a target just sitting on the opposite side of the screen. The player can only do one thing: press the space bar to shoot an arrow. Will you manage to hit the bull's eye?
